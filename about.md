I am so blessed to have experiences from some great Japanese corporations as a software engineer, especially influenced by GIA QUANG PHAT, where all of the products and services are under the spirit, along with the rapid growth, always update new technologies and challenges. I have been setting up such a company in Vietnam where people always work hard, and always excited when facing challenging jobs.

we always utilize the most-updated & the best performance technology to develop website and app. We also happy to join the client from idea phase to design, develop and operation phase. Furthermore, we could also join the designing stage and deploy offshoring for a part of the project.
